# Logging Implementation Summary

## Overview

Comprehensive logging has been implemented throughout the Tashkent Guide application to monitor:

- Database queries and their performance
- Application lifecycle events
- Page navigation and user interactions
- Error handling and debugging
- Image loading success/failure monitoring

## LogService Features

The `LogService` class provides three logging levels:

- **INFO**: General information, successful operations
- **WARN**: Warning messages for non-critical issues
- **ERROR**: Error messages with full stack traces and context

Each log entry includes:

- Timestamp in ISO8601 format
- Log level
- Tag (component identifier)
- Message
- Optional data payload
- Error details and stack traces for errors

## Database Query Logging

### Places Repository (`PlacesRepo`)

All database operations are logged with timing and result counts:

- **getPlaces()**: Fetches all places ordered by creation date

  - Logs: start, success with count, errors with stack trace
  - Timing: Total execution time in milliseconds

- **getPlacesByCategory(categoryId)**: Fetches places by category

  - Logs: start with categoryId, success with count, errors with stack trace
  - Validation: Warns for invalid UUID format
  - Timing: Total execution time in milliseconds

- **getPopularPlaces()**: Fetches high-rated places (rating >= 4.5)

  - Logs: start, success with count and minRating, errors with stack trace
  - Timing: Total execution time in milliseconds

- **getPlaceById(id)**: Fetches single place by ID

  - Logs: start with ID, success with ID, not found warnings, errors with stack trace
  - Timing: Total execution time in milliseconds

- **searchPlaces(query)**: Searches across name, details, and address
  - Logs: start with query, success with count, errors with stack trace
  - Timing: Total execution time in milliseconds

### Categories Repository (`CategoriesRepo`)

All category operations are logged:

- **getCategories()**: Fetches all categories ordered by creation date

  - Logs: start, success with count, errors with stack trace
  - Timing: Total execution time in milliseconds

- **getCategoryById(id)**: Fetches single category by ID
  - Logs: start with ID, success with ID, not found warnings, errors with stack trace
  - Timing: Total execution time in milliseconds

## Application Lifecycle Logging

### Main Application (`Main`)

- **Application start**: Logs when main() function begins
- **Supabase initialization**: Logs successful initialization or failure
- **App launch**: Logs when runApp() is called

### App Component (`App`)

- **MaterialApp build**: Logs when MaterialApp is constructed

### Splash Page (`SplashPage`)

- **Page initialization**: Logs when splash page loads
- **Navigation**: Logs when navigating to main page after delay

### Main Scaffold (`MainScaffold`)

- **Scaffold build**: Logs when main scaffold is constructed
- **Tab navigation**: Logs tab changes with from/to indices

### Home Page (`HomePage`)

- **Page initialization**: Logs when home page loads
- **Data loading**: Logs start and completion of categories/popular places loading
- **Success metrics**: Logs counts of loaded categories and places
- **Error handling**: Logs failures with timing information

### Places by Category Page (`PlacesByCategoryPage`)

- **Page initialization**: Logs when page loads with category details
- **Data loading**: Logs start and completion of places loading for category
- **Success metrics**: Logs count of loaded places
- **Error handling**: Logs failures with category context and timing

### UI Components Logging

#### CategoryCard (`CategoryCard`)

- **Icon loading**: Logs successful icon loads and loading progress
- **Icon errors**: Logs failed icon loads with category context and error details
- **Fallback handling**: Automatically shows default icons when images fail

#### PlaceCard (`PlaceCard`)

- **Image loading**: Logs successful image loads and loading progress
- **Image errors**: Logs failed image loads with place context and error details
- **Fallback handling**: Automatically shows placeholder when images fail

## Supabase Service Logging

### Initialization (`Supabase`)

- **Start**: Logs initialization attempt with configuration
- **Success**: Logs successful initialization with timing and URL
- **Failure**: Logs initialization errors with timing and stack trace

## Log Format Examples

### Success Log

```
[2025-01-27T10:30:15.123Z][INFO][PlacesRepo] getPopularPlaces success | data={count: 8, elapsedMs: 245, minRating: 4.5}
```

### Error Log

```
[2025-01-27T10:30:15.123Z][ERROR][PlacesRepo] getPlaces failed | data={elapsedMs: 1234} | error=PostgrestException: relation "places" does not exist
```

### Warning Log

```
[2025-01-27T10:30:15.123Z][WARN][PlacesRepo] Invalid categoryId format | data={categoryId: invalid-uuid}
```

### Image Loading Logs

```
[INFO][CategoryCard] Category icon loaded successfully | data={categoryId: abc-123, categoryName: Muzeylar, iconUrl: https://example.com/icons/museum.png}
[WARN][CategoryCard] Failed to load category icon | data={categoryId: abc-123, categoryName: Muzeylar, iconUrl: https://example.com/icons/museum.png, error: HTTP request failed, statusCode: 404}
```

## Benefits

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Track query execution times to identify slow operations
2. **Error Debugging**: Full context for errors including stack traces and relevant data
3. **User Journey Tracking**: Monitor page navigation and data loading patterns
4. **Database Health**: Monitor query success rates and identify data issues
5. **Development Support**: Comprehensive logging for development and testing
6. **Image Loading Monitoring**: Track successful and failed image loads with detailed context
7. **UI Performance**: Monitor widget builds and user interactions

## Usage in Development

During development, logs will appear in the Flutter console with detailed information about:

- Database query performance
- Page loading times
- Error occurrences and their context
- User navigation patterns
- Image loading success/failure rates

## Image Loading Error Resolution

The application now handles image loading errors gracefully:

1. **Automatic Fallbacks**: When images fail to load, default icons/placeholders are shown
2. **Detailed Logging**: All image loading attempts are logged with context
3. **User Experience**: Users see appropriate fallback content instead of broken images
4. **Development Insights**: Developers can track which image URLs are problematic

This logging system provides comprehensive visibility into the application's behavior and performance, making it easier to identify and resolve issues during development and testing.
